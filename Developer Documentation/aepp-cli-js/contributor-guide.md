## Install `aecli` from git repository

1. Clone the [aepp-cli-js](../../docs/aepp-cli-js/git@github.com:aeternity/aepp-cli-js.git) git repository into any place you like
2. With your terminal: enter in folder when the repo has been cloned
3. Run `npm link` for linking `aecli` executable to `src/aecli.js`
4. Start a new terminal session and try `aecli` command to see if everything is okay.
5. If you have any issue, open an [issue](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-cli-js/issues/new) in github

If you have problems linking, try also `npm install` and then `npm link`. Instead of using `npm link` you can also execute `./src/aecli.js` directly.
